# Space Home Commander System

A project to revise the Command design pattern, Exceptions, Data Structures and Graphs. The Space Home project is related to the Space Mission Planner, the first part of this project series.

The project brief was generated by ChatGPT, and is as follows (note that I may have deviated from this brief, as the brief was meant only for guidance and structure):

This project involves creating a simplified Smart Home Automation System that allows users to manage various devices in a smart home. The system will incorporate the Command design pattern to handle device operations, custom exceptions to manage errors, and utilize various data structures to store and manage the devices and their states. Additionally, a graph representation of the smart home network will be used to demonstrate Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal algorithms.

### Objectives
- Implement the Command design pattern to manage smart home device operations.
- Create custom exceptions: one runtime exception and one checked exception.
- Utilize various data structures: lists, sets, maps, queues, and stacks.
- Represent the smart home network as a graph and implement BFS and DFS traversals.
### Tasks
1. Command Design Pattern: Implement commands for turning devices on and off.
2. Custom Exceptions:
- DeviceNotFoundException (checked exception)
- DeviceAlreadyOnException (runtime exception).
3. Data Structures:
- Use a list to store the history of commands.
- Use a set to manage the unique types of devices.
- Use a map to associate device names with their states.
- Use a queue to simulate device tasks.
- Use a stack to implement an undo feature for commands.
4. Graph and Traversal:
- Represent the smart home as a graph.
- Implement BFS and DFS to traverse the smart home network.
### Project Structure
- Main Class: Demonstrates the functionality.
- Command Interface: Interface for command operations.
- Concrete Command Classes: Specific commands for devices.
- Invoker Class: Executes commands.
- Device Class: Represents a smart home device.
- Graph Class: Represents the smart home network graph.
- Exception Classes: Custom exceptions for device errors.
- SmartHomeAutomationSystem Class: Main system logic.
